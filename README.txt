==== PROJECT NAME ==== 

KID is dirty
Because he is playing in the MUD


==== PROJECT DESCRIPTION ==== 

A MUD (Multi User Dungeon) is a text- based online game where players 
perform actions by typing them (such as “go north” or “attack goblin”). 
The world is partitioned into zones, and each player exists in one zone 
at any one time, and can move to neighboring zones. Zones can be occupied 
by several players as well as one or more NPC (Non player characters) that 
can be interacted with (e.g. attacked).

==== MAKE IT HAPPEN ==== 

Using the make utility you can perform the following actions:

make              ==> Compiles the Erlang source files if necessary. 
make archive      ==> Creates a gziped tar archive of this directory. 
make clean        ==> Removes all beam files and html files generated by Edoc.
make doc          ==> Generates Edoc documentation in the doc/html directory.
make setup	  ==> Performs first-time setup of database
make start_server ==> Starts the server.
make start_client ==> Starts the client.
make test         ==> Runs all Eunit tests.


==== TO COMPILE ==== 

To compile the project, simply type make and press enter.


==== TO RUN AND TEST THE SYSTEM ==== 

To use the MUD, you need to start the server. The server needs a database, so
begin by typing "make setup". This is nessescary only once.
You then start the server by typing "make start_server".
To connect to it from another terminal, type "make start_client" and use the supplied command to start a client sesion against the server.

When you have logged in, you can write this, among other things:
go north        ==> Moves to zone adjacent to the north
say Hi!		==> Says Hi! to the other players
attack Peter	==> Attacks Peter
stop   		==> You just wanted to intimidate him, so you stop attacking
logout		==> Peter is mad with you, so you better leave
