==== PROJECT NAME ==== 

KID is dirty
Because he is playing in the MUD


==== PROJECT DESCRIPTION ==== 

A MUD (Multi User Dungeon) is a text- based online game where players 
perform actions by typing them (such as “go north” or “attack goblin”). 
The world is partitioned into zones, and each player exists in one zone 
at any one time, and can move to neighboring zones. Zones can be occupied 
by several players as well as one or more NPC (Non player characters) that 
can be interacted with (e.g. attacked).
